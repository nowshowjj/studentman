Our goal is to help facilitate communication between parents and administrators concerning student behavior. We believe that thorough documentation is key to creating student behavior plans and goals. We hope to make this process easier for teachers, administrators, and parents.

Here, the teachers can keep track of a student's behavior, good or bad. Often times when a teacher goes to an administrator about
a problem with a student, the first question is, "Did you document it?", and too often, the answer is no.

This will allow the teacher to have a way to document a child's behavior and have the entries be uploaded immediately and be updated
as needed. The teacher will be able to create multiple entries for a student, helping to document patterns of behavior and any 
concerns the teacher may have.
